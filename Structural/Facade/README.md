# Facade Pattern

## Intent
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Problem
A complex subsystem has many interdependent classes with complicated interfaces, making it difficult for clients to use.

## Solution
The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use while still allowing access to the full functionality when needed.

## When to Use
- You want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem
- There are many dependencies between clients and implementation classes
- You want to layer your subsystems

## C# Implementation
Coming soon - see [Program.cs](./Program.cs) when available.

## Pros
- Isolates clients from subsystem components
- Promotes weak coupling between subsystems and clients
- Simplifies the interface for common use cases

## Cons
- A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app
- May become too complex if not designed carefully
