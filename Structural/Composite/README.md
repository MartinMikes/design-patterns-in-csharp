# Composite Pattern

## Intent
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## Problem
You need to work with tree structures of objects where individual objects and groups of objects should be treated uniformly.

## Solution
The Composite pattern composes objects into tree structures and allows treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly through a common interface.

## When to Use
- You want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
- You want clients to ignore the difference between compositions and individual objects
- You need to implement a tree-like object structure

## C# Implementation
Coming soon - see [Program.cs](./Program.cs) when available.

## Pros
- Can work with complex tree structures more conveniently
- Open/Closed Principle - introduce new element types without breaking existing code
- Clients can treat all objects uniformly

## Cons
- Might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes with very different functionality
- Can make design overly general
